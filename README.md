# Blog_app

In this project we will be using Ruby on Rails to implement a blog website using full-stack technologies.


## Setup
1) Go to your terminal and navigate to where you store project repositories
2) Run the command `$git clone git@github.com:AKeeganDev/blog_app.git`

## Run
1) Navigate to the source folder in your terminal
2) Open in your editor of choice
3) run `bundle install`
4) run `rails db:create`, `rails db:migrate`
5) run `rails s` to start the server and create an account
6) After creating an account you will receive a notice in your terminal with a link to confirm the email. ctrl+click the confirmation link and you will be authenticated and can log in
7) Play around with the app and have fun!

## Testing
run the following after cloning the repository
- `rspec`
- Some tests have become obselete due to development. Bear with me as I update this project (not currently in development right now)
